    'Healing was founded by Payam Abubakr in 2021. It was called Healing Online, and started as a blog and an online community where some of the world&lsquo;s therapists shared their research and ideas. We launched the Beginner&lsquo;s Guide to Therapy and our first study, and that hub of industry expertise transformed into a small consulting firm and led us to create the Online Therapist of today!',
  aboutHeader:
    'At Healing, we believe there is a better way to do things. A more valuable way where customers are earned rather than bought. We&lsquo;re obsessively passionate about it, and our mission is to help people achieve it. We focus on search engine optimization. It&lsquo;s one of the least understood and least transparent aspects of great marketing, and we see that as an opportunity. We&lsquo;re excited to simplify SEO for everyone through our software, education, and community.&lsquo;',
