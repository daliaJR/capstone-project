          At Healing, we believe there is a better way to do things. A more
          valuable way where customers are earned rather than bought.
          We&lsquo;re obsessively passionate about it, and our mission is to
          help people achieve it. We focus on search engine optimization.
          It&lsquo;s one of the least understood and least transparent aspects
          of great marketing, and we see that as an opportunity. We&lsquo;re
          excited to simplify SEO for everyone through our software, education,
          and community.&lsquo;
